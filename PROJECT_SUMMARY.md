## 🧠 Behavioral Flow Implementation

### Scenario 1: Complete Profile → Accurate Matches ✓
**Flow:**
1. User lands on homepage → clicks "Get Started"
2. Uploads resume file
3. Fills complete profile:
   - Name: Wong Beng Hwa
   - Degree: Bachelor of Computer Science
   - Skills: JavaScript, Python, Java, React, Node.js, SQL, Git, etc.
   - Interests: Web Development, Backend Systems, etc.
4. Completes personality quiz (all 5 questions)
5. Profile completion: 100%

**Result:**
- High-quality job matches appear:
  - FinTech Corporation (91% match)
  - AI Innovations Lab (85% match)
  - DataInsight Analytics (78% match)
  - Apples Inc. (73% match)
- Detailed match reasons provided
- Skill gap analysis shows mostly green bars
- Few improvement suggestions

### Scenario 2: Incomplete Profile → Poor Matches → Recalibration ✓
**Flow:**
1. User provides minimal information:
   - Only name and degree
   - Skips or selects <3 skills
2. Profile completion: 25-50%

**Result:**
- Poor matches appear:
  - Data Entry Clerk (35% match)
  - Marketing Assistant (28% match)
  - Customer Service Intern (22% match)
- Generic, non-technical roles
- User frustrated by poor matches

**Recalibration:**
3. User clicks "Recalibrate Profile"
4. Adds comprehensive skills list (10+ skills)
5. Reorders skills by priority
6. Updates interests
7. Clicks "Recalibrate & Find Matches"
8. Loading animation (2 seconds)

**New Result:**
- Better matches appear with higher scores
- Technical roles aligned with skills
- Improved skill gap analysis
- Success message displayed

### State Persistence
- In-memory only (Zustand store)
- Refreshing page resets all data
- No localStorage/database
- Session-based only

**Modify Colors:**
Edit `/tailwind.config.js` → `theme.extend.colors`

**Change Animations:**
Edit `/tailwind.config.js` → `theme.extend.animation`
